Tomorrow we'll be recording short videos of you all describing and presenting one of your apps.

Videos have higher quality when a script has been created before recording. Today's reflection is going to help you think through what 
you would like to say in your video clip.

1) What project will you present?

2) What skills did you need to learn in order to build your app?

3) What about your app are you most proud of?

4) What is the next app you'd like to create after this?

Bonus question:

5) 4) What has attending Maydm's Appetite for Apps meant for you? Who would you recommend this program to?
