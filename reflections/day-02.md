Capture your thoughts for the day:

1) After watching Joy's video, what are your thoughts about bias in algorithms? Does it matter? If so, why? If not, why not? 
2) Do you want to see a future with less or no bias in algorithms? What could you do to help accomplish that goal?
3) What's something that you learned today that surprised you? What was surprising or notable about it?
